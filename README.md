# CBSm

Cubic Bezier Splines for Matlab

This package contains the MATLAB functions necessary to use CBS in fitting intertemporal choice and risky choice utility functions.

The folder 'CBSm' contains the actual functions necessary to run. This is the only folder that's technically needed. Add this folder to the MATLAB path, and you should be good to go.

The folder 'examples' contains an example MATLAB script and example data to show how you can use the functions in the folder 'CBSm'. This is for your aid only, and is not a necessary part of the package.

The folder 'java_src' contains the original java code for the function 'CBScalc.class', which is inside CBSm. This is here so that you can look at the source code if you want to, but this is not a necessary part of the package as the compiled code 'CBScalc.class' is already located inside the folder 'CBSm'.
